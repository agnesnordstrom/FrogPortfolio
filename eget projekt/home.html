				<h3>Frog quote</h3>
				<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog">
					<mark>A frog is any member of a diverse and largely carnivorous group of short-bodied,
						tailless amphibians composing the order Anura</mark>(ἀνούρα, literally without tail
					in Ancient Greek). The oldest fossil "proto-frog" Triadobatrachus is known from
					the Early Triassic of Madagascar, but molecular clock dating suggests their split
					from other amphibians may extend further back to the Permian, 265 million years ago.

						<h3>Frogs in culture</h3>
					</header>
					<p> <strong> Frogs have been featured in mythology, fairy tales and popular culture. </strong>
						In traditional Chinese myths, the world rests on a giant frog, who would
						try to swallow the moon, causing the lunar eclipse. Frogs have been featured
						in religion, folklore, and popular culture. The ancient Egyptians depicted
						the god Heqet, protector of newborns, with the head of a frog. For the Mayans,
						frogs represented water, crops, fertility and birth and were associated
						with the god Chaac. In the Bible, Moses unleashes a plague of frogs on the
						Egyptians. Medieval Europeans associated frogs and toads with evil and
						witchcraft. The Brothers Grimm fairy tale The Frog Prince features
						a princess taking in a frog and it turning into a handsome prince. </p>

						<h3>What to feed a frog</h3>
					</header>
					<p>A varied complete diet is essential to ensure the health and longevity of a frog.
						Live insects and/or commercially manufactured pellets can be used to feed frogs.
						Insects commonly fed to frogs include: crickets, Dubia roaches, black soldier fly
						larva, mealworms, superworms, waxworms, earthworms, and redworms.
					</p>
					<p><Strong>Frogs should not be fed any human food within their diet.</strong> Frogs should be
						offered an appropriately
						sized food item every 2-3 days for juveniles or 2-3 times/week for adult frogs. Prey items
						should
						be offered until the frog no longer wants to consume them. Once this occurs, remove any
						remaining
						prey items from the enclosure. Some live insects can injure frogs if left unattended.
					</p>
					<p>
						Prior to feeding any frog, an insect's nutritional value can improve by performing either
						gut loading or dusting them with calcium and a multivitamin powder. This step is vital to
						ensure your frog will live a long life with adequate nutrition.
					</p>
					<p>Food can be offered within the enclosure in a small area such as a dish. To prevent
						any ingestion of the substrate within an enclosure a frog can be fed outside of its enclosure
						in a small Tupperware container.
					</p>
					<p>
						Water can be provided to frogs using several different methods. These include a water bowl,
						a misting system, or a water feature with a waterfall. If an enclosure is large enough a
						custom area can be provided by adhering a pre-cut piece of glass or acrylic to create an
						aquatic area using silicone adhesive. With these advanced methods of providing water–
						filtration may be needed. Maintaining humidity within the environment with water is vital to
						thrive in a captive setting.

				<ol>
					<li> <span class="fat">Amphibious Wonders:</span> Frogs are amphibians, which means they can live
						both in water and on land.
						They are well-adapted to these dual environments.
					</li>
					<li><span class="fat">Diverse Species:</span> There are over 4,700 known species of frogs, found on
						every continent except Antarctica.
						They come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and colors.
					</li>
					<li><span class="fat">Sensitive Skin:</span> Frogs have permeable skin that allows them to breathe
						through their skin. This also makes
						them highly sensitive to environmental changes, making them excellent indicators of
						environmental health.
					</li>
					<li><span class="fat">Unique Sounds:</span> Frogs are known for their distinctive croaking and
						chirping sounds, which they produce by
						inflating their vocal sacs. Each species has its own unique call
						.</li>
					<li><span class="fat">Jumping Masters:</span> Frogs are exceptional jumpers. Some can leap up to 20
						times their body length in a single
						jump, thanks to their powerful leg muscles.
					</li>
					<li><span class="fat">Life Cycle:</span> Frogs undergo a remarkable metamorphosis from tadpole to
						adult. They start as aquatic
						tadpoles with gills and eventually develop into air-breathing adults with legs.
					</li>
					<li><span class="fat">Eyes and Vision:</span> Frogs have large, bulging eyes with a nictitating
						membrane (a transparent eyelid)
						that helps protect their eyes and keep them moist. They have excellent night vision.
					</li>
					<li><span class="fat">Tongue Action:</span> Frogs have long, sticky tongues that they use to catch
						insects and other prey. Their
						tongues can be up to two times the length of their bodies.
					</li>
					<li><span class="fat">Camouflage Artists:</span> Many frog species have evolved to blend in with
						their surroundings, which helps
						them evade predators. Some even have the ability to change color.
					</li>
					<li><span class="fat">Conservation:</span> Frogs are facing numerous threats, including habitat loss
						and a deadly fungal disease
						called chytridiomycosis. Conservation efforts are crucial to protecting these unique creatures.
